31 Jun 2011: 
`proto` directory contains my prototyping work on going from scraped data to 
correctly formatted documentation, and perhaps eventually to functions or

Files in .txt are data gleaned from running scraper.py
And using bs4 (beautiful soup alpha) folder copied to dist-packages (on 
ubuntu 10.10, path is `/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages`)
